#Skype Chat Archive 

##What
âš  Mac OS only

Export your Skype chat history with a given contact to a csv file.

##How

Everything is stored locally in sql tables.

Simply query them & save the result to a file

##Run

* Add execution rights to the sh script : `$ chmod +x skype.sh`
* `$ sh skype.sh {my-skype-username} {contact-username}`

That's it, a {contact-username}.csv file should be waiting for you.


##Thanks

Didn't do anything myself.
